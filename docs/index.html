            One form of "sign and wonder" is an astronomical phenomenon (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.14?lang=eng#p13">Gen 1:14</a>). These phenomena in the heavens (e.g., planetary conjunctions, eclipses) recur regularly; viewed on a big enough timescale, their recurrences average out. However, there can be intervals when many phenomena with different cycles happen in quick succession. For example, in most years, 2 lunar eclipses and 2 solar eclipses occur. [<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/eclipse/The-frequency-of-solar-and-lunar-eclipses">1</a>, <a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-solar-or-lunar-eclipses-in-one-calendar-year/">2</a>] This seems to have happened recently. The year 2000 had 6 eclipses [<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/2000">3</a>], and was extremely rare for having 3 eclipses in a single month (next time that happens will be in 2206). 2011 and 2020 also had 6 eclipses, and 2013, 2018, and 2019 each had 5 eclipses [<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-solar-or-lunar-eclipses-in-one-calendar-year/">4</a>]. One of the 2019 eclipses was the particularly exotic "super blood wolf moon" [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-to-watch-super-blood-wolf-moon-lunar-eclipse">5</a>]. In roughly the same era, we have also seen seen the closest Mars opposition in 60,000 years [<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/close-and-far-martian-oppositions/">6</a>], a rare pair of Venus transits [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus">7</a>], and a notable series of conjunctions [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)">8</a>]. The tight sequence in May 2000, and the unusually close Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 2020, were particularly interesting [<a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/the-400-year-rhythm-of-great-conjunctions/">9</a>, <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html">10</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction">11</a>].

            It's important to note that the language of the prophecy does not just say that the wonders will <em>occur</em>; it says that the wonders will be <em>seen</em> and <em>shown forth</em>. The advent of better technology, more media coverage, and increased globalization has made awareness of local and contemporary astronomical events much greater than in past centuries. Manned missions to space have certainly shown forth wonders.

            We also have the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/">Hubble</a> and <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb telescopes</a>, and many similar instruments, which are revealing wondrous things, including much from long ago and far away. This is a time period when we have robots broadcasting pictures from Mars, and probes flying next to and then far beyond ice giants. We have discovered exoplanets, cosmic background radiation, quasars, pulsars, solar nurseries, and the Higgs Boson. We've also located and even imaged black holes.

            The prophecy also predicts wonders seen and shown forth in the earth beneath. In our day, astronauts report experiencing an "overview effect" when they gaze down in wonder on the earth beneath. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect">12</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/apollo-17-blue-marble/">13</a>"). Paleontology has discovered numerous wonders in the earth, and Hollywood and popular culture have certainly shown some of them forth. Seismic imaging has revealed anomalies inside our planet that are remnants of formation events billions of years ago. [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06589-1">14</a>] Neutrinos are detected and measured deep inside the earth, and are revealing its mysterious internal structure. [<a href="https://www.futurity.org/geoneutrinos-detected-deep-inside-earth/">15</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0319-1">16</a>]. We've discovered and explored lakes buried under thousands of meters of ice in Antarctica.
