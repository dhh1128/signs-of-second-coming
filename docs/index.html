        Although Christ gave wicked behaviors as an example, "as in the days of Noah" may mean additional things, too. Noah, a genuine prophet with priesthood authority, had long preached and been ignored. He had been working for a long time on preparations, and the ark was ready. The imaginations of the hearts of men were evil continually. All flesh was corrupted.

        This is part of a parable, so its application requires particular help from the Spirit. There are plenty of people who do the wicked things described in this sign, but the parable seems to indicate that these are bona fide servants of the master, "whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.49?lang=eng#p48">JS-M 1:49</a>). Could these be a prophecy of some apostate groups that abuse their followers, such as the FLDS?

            Although the sun and moon being darkened could refer to the effects of pollution and forest fires and volcanic eruptions, this seems to be a future event, because the powers of heaven being shaken seems to require something dramatic. Stars falling from heaven could refer to dramatic meteor showers, or to the earth's orbit being disturbed in a way that makes large numbers of satellites decay in orbit and crash to earth.

    <td>Modern athiesm is more aggressive than it was anciently, it promotes naturalism and disses religion as hokum, and it asserts that the present evolves with no events of divine intervention at all. However, athiesm is not necessarily the only manifestation of this mindset. Those who say that God did something remarkable, anciently, but that He doesn't intervene today, are really imagining up unto themselves a God who can change, and who isn't particularly involved in our modern life (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.7-11?lang=eng#p6">Morm 9:7-11</a>). Scoffers who separate themselves also seems to refer to those who once had fellowship with Christ's followers, but who have "stepped away" -- a phenomenon that is becoming distressingly common. This seems to be related to Christ's condemnation of modern religious teachers who have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng#p18">JS-H 1:19</a>).

            One form of "sign and wonder" is an astronomical phenomenon (see <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.14?lang=eng#p13">Gen 1:14</a>). These phenomena in the heavens (e.g., planetary conjunctions, eclipses) recur regularly; viewed on a big enough timescale, their recurrences average out. However, there can be intervals when many phenomena with different cycles happen in quick succession. This seems to have happened recently. For example, in most years, 2 lunar eclipses and 2 solar eclipses occur. [<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/eclipse/The-frequency-of-solar-and-lunar-eclipses">1</a>, <a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-solar-or-lunar-eclipses-in-one-calendar-year/">2</a>] The year 2000 had 6 eclipses [<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/2000">3</a>], and was extremely rare for having 3 eclipses in a single month (next time that happens will be in 2206). 2011 and 2020 also had 6 eclipses, and 2013, 2018, and 2019 each had 5 eclipses [<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-solar-or-lunar-eclipses-in-one-calendar-year/">4</a>]. One of the 2019 eclipses was the particularly exotic "super blood wolf moon" [<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-to-watch-super-blood-wolf-moon-lunar-eclipse">5</a>]. In roughly the same era, we have also seen seen the closest Mars opposition in 60,000 years [<a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/close-and-far-martian-oppositions/">6</a>], a rare pair of Venus transits [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus">7</a>], and a notable series of conjunctions [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)">8</a>]. The tight sequence in May 2000, and the unusually close Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 2020, were particularly remarkble [<a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/the-400-year-rhythm-of-great-conjunctions/">9</a>, <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html">10</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction">11</a>].

            However, it's important to note that the language of the prophecy doesn't just say that the wonders will <em>occur</em>; it says that the wonders will be <em>seen</em> and <em>shown forth</em>. The advent of better technology, more media coverage, and increased globalization has made awareness of local and contemporary astronomical events much greater than in past centuries. Ages ago, a person might have one experience with an eclipse in their lifetime; now, I have heard stories about notable eclipses dozens of times. Manned missions to space have certainly shown forth wonders while the world watched, too.
        </p>

            We also have the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/">Hubble</a> and <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb telescopes</a>, and many similar instruments, which are <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/world/webb-telescope-milky-way-heart-scn/index.html">revealing wondrous things</a>, including much from long ago and far away. This is a time period when we have robots broadcasting pictures from Mars, and probes flying next to and then far beyond ice giants. We have discovered exoplanets, cosmic background radiation, quasars, pulsars, solar nurseries, and the Higgs Boson. We've also located and even imaged black holes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prophecy also predicts wonders seen and shown forth in the earth beneath. In our day, astronauts report experiencing an "overview effect" when they gaze down in wonder on the earth beneath. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect">12</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/apollo-17-blue-marble/">13</a>"). Paleontology has discovered numerous wonders in the earth, and Hollywood and popular culture have shown some of them forth. Seismic imaging has revealed anomalies inside our planet that are remnants of formation events billions of years ago. [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06589-1">14</a>] Neutrinos are detected and measured deep inside the earth, and are revealing its mysterious internal structure. [<a href="https://www.futurity.org/geoneutrinos-detected-deep-inside-earth/">15</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0319-1">16</a>]. We've discovered and explored lakes buried under thousands of meters of ice in Antarctica.
